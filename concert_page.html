Their opening acts, Neon Trees and Owl City, were great, really amped up the crowd to see the main act. Their lights and backdrop effects were amazing (they had a projector, so the scene changed for each song to fit the mood of it). Adam would tell stories and talk to the crowd in between songs. He even took a woman's camera and took a video! His singing and the rest of the band's performance was incredible. I would definitely go see them again!!</p></td><tr>

No weather issues in the "Golden State".</p><p>Kelly Clarkson was great and a hard act to follow but Maroon 5 was up for the challenge and absolutely rocked the joint. Great sound, great show, lots of eye candy for guys and girls alike. I saw Maroon 5 about 10 years ago during the Songs About Jane tour and neither show was a disappointment. My only complaint is Maroon 5 did not play long enough.But that can be said about any great show, including 3 hours of The Eagles. Can't wait for the next tour.</p></td><tr>
